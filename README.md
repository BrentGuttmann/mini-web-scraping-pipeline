# Mini Web-Scraping Pipeline

## What's This?

This is a simple demo pipeline that demonstrates how to scrape data from different sorts of webpages using python and bash scripting.

This repo is forked from [this template python project](https://github.com/dwd-umd/python-project-template), so you may want to check that our first in order to see how to set up a full-featured python3 project in the popular text editor Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## Quick Start

From a linux-like OS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwd-umd/miniWebScrapingPipeline.git
cd miniWebScrapingPipeline
source _initial_setup.sh
sh _run_pipeline_1.sh
```

## Web Scraping Overview

HTML provides the skeleton of every web site. If you want to systematically extract data from web pages, then you need to get the html on to your computer, and parse through the html syntax with a script.

Whether it's faster/easier to get the data you want by manually copying/pasting, or by writing a script is a judgement you have to make on the following kinds of consideration:

- How much content is there? Obviously, the more content there is, the more sense it makes to write a script.
- How consistent is the html? If the html is well-written and consistent, then it will be easy to extract the data you want. If it's all over the place (e.g. Wikipedia, which is generated by all sorts of diverse minds), then you'll be in for a challenge. Another key consideration is whether the html is generated using javascript on the browser (discussed below).
- How much fun will it be to write a script for a given site?

In order to make these sorts of somewhat subjective judgments, you need to visually examine the html on your target web page and figure out essentially how the target website is built before designing your approach.

This repo provides 3 exemplary pipelines for different kinds of webpage and approach. By studying these three sorts of pipeline, you can learn a lot about the essential concepts of web scarping in particular and web development in general.

## Pipelines: General Concept

Python is a very handy language for writing a pipeline. A pipeline is a set of scripts that takes an input data set and sequentially outputs a modified data set. By breaking a pipeline up into multiple steps of input and output files, you make your data modification process easier to debug and develop.

## Pipeline 1: Simple HTML

To operate this pipeline, run `sh _run_pipeline_1.sh` with no arguments.

## Pipeline 3: Trigger JS in Simulated Browser

For this approach you need:

- `geckodriver`. If you're on a Mac, you can install this with `brew install geckodriver`. If you're on linux then there are some instructions [here](https://askubuntu.com/a/871077/896933)
